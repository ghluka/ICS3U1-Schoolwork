# 🎓 ICS3U1 Schoolwork

This repository is comprised of all the code I've written for my grade 11 computer science course.

Due to the nature of the course, we can only use knowledge taught (see the bottom for concepts learned in each unit) in the course.

## 💪 Warmups

The `warmups` directory contains all solutions to problems given by the teacher to solve. These aren't worth marks but to practice our skills learned in class.

## 🏋️ Exercises

The `exercises` directory contains all warmups that were required to be submitted to the teacher.

## 📜 Tasks

The `tasks` directory contains all evaluations worth marks that were done online. These are typically just the final projects of a unit as other evaluations (tests, quizzes and examinations) were all done on paper.

### 🧪 Testers

Testers are the programs provided by the teacher for running the functions created in each test. Most testers were incomplete on purpose, with "TODO" messages left by the teacher as a hint for what to complete.

Testers were to be submitted alongside the functions, with the modifications by students being worth marks. The testers included in each task's directory includes the modifications I made to the testers.
